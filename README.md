## Hiii: mid C/Systems programmer.

Currently interested in [TrapC](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3423.pdf) and ARM assembly.
Nothing noteworthy to see here really as I mainly [self-host my git repositories](https://git.logjd.com).

#### If you need to contact me: `logan@logjd.com` works.
