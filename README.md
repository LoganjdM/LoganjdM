## Hiii: mid C/Systems programmer.

Currently exploring [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and interested in [TrapC](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3423.pdf).
Nothing noteworthy to see here really as I mainly self-host my git repositories.

## Currently:

- Working on [Cu-Fied](https://github.com/LoganjdM/cu-fied) and some other local repo's I have.
- Interested in GNU's various projects.
- Interested in GNU's inline assembly GCC extension.
- Interested and actively learning various OS syscalls like linux `mmap()`, and windows `VirtualAlloc()`.

#### If you need to contact me: `logan@mccuistion.my` works.
